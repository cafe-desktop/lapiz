General Information
===================

lapiz is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text editor for the MATE

Complete MATE integration is featured, with support for Drag and Drop (DnD)
from Caja (the MATE file manager), the use of the MATE help system,

Running Tests
==================
Lapiz has several test that can be run after compilation. Run them by issueing "make check". However there are a couple of requirements that need to be satisfied before they will pass.

* You need the gsettings schemas installed for some tests to be able to run.
* You need to mount sftp://localhost/ with gvfs-mount for one test to pass.

If test fail and you have setup the above correctly then please file a bug report as described below.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the MATE bug tracking system:

  https://github.com/cafe-desktop/lapiz/issues 
  
You will need to create an account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and cafe libraries
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stack trace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.
